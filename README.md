# Skuvault Bulk SKU Creator

This app allows users with a Skuvault warehouse managment system account to create new item SKUs in bulk based on their colors and sizes. It has been tailored for the SKU naming scheme used by Amaryllis Apparel. Making the bulk creator more flexible for use in other systems is a future goal but not in progress at the moment.

## Development
This app is running on NodeJs with the Express framework. It utilizes the MongoDB noSQL database for minimal storage needs. The front end uses ejs templating and standard CSS/Javascript for styling and functionality.
